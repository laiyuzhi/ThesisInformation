## Thesis Registration Checklist
To actually register and start your thesis, you need three documents:

- **Anmeldung B.Sc./M.Sc Abschlussarbeit (PDF)**: for the Prüfungssekretariat (download the `"Anmeldung B.Sc./M.Sc Abschlussarbeit (PDF)"`  from [Informationen und Formulare](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/studium/studierende/downloads/informationen-und-formulare/))
- **New Member Registration Form**: to register with our chair (PC account, keys, ...): [NewMemberRegistrationForm](Documents/new_member_v2.14.odt); [guide](Documents/new_member_v2.13.png)) on what you need to fill out (ignore the version missmatch)
- **Thesis Description**: a written description to clearly specify the thesis scope and goals. This is normally the thesis description you found on our website. 
    - Make sure everything you want to do is included.
    - Make sure the goals required to succeed are clearly specified (and not too simple or too complicated).
    - Make sure you like the title.
    - Examples:

        - [MA Topic Description Skeleton](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KSHxpYyuzGTeAS9YtfURSxvGVGhJHYPVFkRXBwS_OX4/edit?usp=sharing)
        - [Example MA Topic Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Occ33t0WR2acv4TvGPmU-Hl5YFcavM_-p3D6-A3g9c/edit?usp=sharing)

### Hand-in / Signatures
After you have all three documents, come to the chair and bring them:

1. **Anmeldung B.Sc./M.Sc Abschlussarbeit (PDF)** has to be signed by the professor. If you are registering a M.Sc. Thesis, you also need the signature of your second examiner. Also bring your **Thesis Description**!
2. **New Member Registration Form** is given to our IT-Administrator.
3. Make three copies of the signed **Anmeldung B.Sc./M.Sc Abschlussarbeit (PDF)**:
     - one for the professor (and your second examinor)
     - one for your supervisor
     - one for yourself
4. Hand in the original signed **Anmeldung B.Sc./M.Sc Abschlussarbeit (PDF)** to the Prüfungssekretariat.

**Send me a quick message before you come, so we can hand things in together.**

## Workplace
We can provide you with a workplace in the student room at our chair. This includes a desk with PC that we will set up for your use for your thesis. However, you should only use this if you will work some amount of time in person at our chair. If you plan to work from home most of the time anyways, please do not block a workplace for other students. **Please tell us if you don't use your workplace so that we can reassign it!** 

### Compute Clusters
At our chair we have access to multiple compute clusters. You can get access to these, if you require larger amounts of compute. 

#### Local
There are three single node clusters with 8xRTX3090, 8xA5000 and 4xA5000 GPUs for direct compute access, managed by our chair. **These clusters require some setup. Ask me for details!**

#### [TCML](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/kognitive-systeme/projects/tcml-cluster/)
This is a shared compute cluster administrated by our chair. If you have high compute demands, this is what I generally recommend to use.
#### [ML Cloud](https://portal.mlcloud.uni-tuebingen.de/mlcloud-pages/news)
This is the shared ML Cloud cluster of the University of Tuebingen with large amounts of compute available (i.e. nodes with H100 GPUs with up to 80GB VRAM / GPU). However, access times might not be ideal due to queueing.

<!-- General FAQ:
- Environments: `/data/<username>/conda_envs`. In general, `/data/<username>` is where large things should go.
- Repositories can typically live under `/home`. But if you create large checkpoints, you may want them on `/data`.
  - Note: Hugging Face caches often go to `$HOME/.cache` regardless of repo location. A potential solution is to symlink `~/.cache` to `/data/<username>` (just a first idea). -->

## Supervision
- We typically meet weekly at most. Depending on preference and progress, we can meet less often.
- Please prepare a short update for meetings: what you did, what you plan to do next, and (most importantly) questions. This can be notes or a small slide deck.
- We use Discord to communicate within the group (email me to get an invite!), and we will create a channel for your thesis. Please contact me sooner rather than later via Discord if you have questions (I usually reply quickly).
- In an early meeting you should create a **planned timeline for the whole project**.

## Writing the thesis
You should follow general academic writing tips, e.g.:
- Use active voice
- Stick to a consistent tense
- Be concise
- Be formal

Your thesis should roughly follow this outline (deviations are fine if you have good reasons; feel free to ask me!):
1. Introduction
2. Related Work
3. Method
4. Experiments
5. Results
6. Discussion
7. Conclusion and Future Work

- **Literature review:** Use search engines like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/).
- **Introductory resources on how to read papers:** [How To Read A Paper (by S. Keshav)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs114/reading-keshav.pdf) and [Reading Research Papers by Andrew Ng](https://youtu.be/733m6qBH-jI)

### Format Requirements
- You should use a good LaTeX template.
    - You can find Thesis Templates from our chair at: https://gitlab.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/templates/thesis (You will need access to our GitLab to access this site. If you can't acess it, you can ask me!). 
    - Alternatively you can use the Thesis Templates from here: https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/integrative-transkriptomik/abschlussarbeiten/
- **The written text should be roughly 30-60 pages for a Bachelors Thesis or 40-70 pages for a Masters Thesis**
- **The front page needs to match the one in the template above**
- **The printed thesis needs to be bound with "Schwarze Klebebindung", with a transparent front and a black back.**
- **You are required to append and sign the `Erklärung Abschlussarbeit (PDF)` found at [Informationen und Formulare](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/studium/studierende/downloads/informationen-und-formulare/).** I generally recommend selecting `3.2` and `3.3`. 
- Figures should be legible (large enough text, sensible colors, ...). If possible, store figures as PDF (e.g., export from matplotlib as PDF). For consistent plotting you might want to use the [tueplots](https://github.com/pnkraemer/tueplots) library.
- Every figure, table, and pseudo-code you add should be mentioned and cited in the text.
- If you make claims, back them up with scientific literature (papers) or experimental results.
- Captions (the text under figures) should be self-contained.
- Citations should follow a consistent citation style (LaTeX + BibTeX).

### Handing in the Thesis
- Please refer to [Wo und wie gebe ich meine Bachelor- oder Masterarbeit ab?](https://uni-tuebingen.de/de/268383#c2073306) for specific instructions on handing in your thesis.
- **Most importantly, you need to hand in the pdf of your Thesis to your respective Prüfungssekretariat by mail before your deadline.**
-  Additionally, you need to hand in a printed version of your thesis with "Schwarze Klebebindung" since the professor generally requires this.
-  The deadline for Prüfungssekretariat is binding. **Make sure you know what you should submit to them and when.**
-  The printed versions for the professor can be provided in the week after your submission deadline. **Clarify with us first!** 

### Printing
You may print your thesis on one of our printers for free. You then only need to bind it at a copy shop ("Schwarze Klebebindung" is required, don't forget the cover & back, which you can also get from us).

## Thesis Presentation
Roughly two weeks to one month after the formal submission of your written thesis, you will have your thesis presentation. To schedule this, you will need to find a date that works for you and all the examiners. The thesis presentation itself should be 30 minutes long, followed by approximately 15–30 minutes of questions, or a live demo. Expect that questions are asked during the presentation; in that case, the pure presentation time is, of course, extended.
- It is your job to schedule a date for your thesis presentation with all your examinors.
- Make sure that the amount of content fits within the given time. A good rule of thumb is that you can cover at most one slide per minute. Often, less is better (I would recommend around 23 slides for 30 minutes), so that the talk does not become hectic.
- Send your presentation slides to your supervisor approximately **one week before the presentation** (at the latest, two days before the presentation)
- **Your presentation style should be 'free'; Avoid bringing notes which you only read off!**
- You should present in a natural and engaging way: E.g. do not simply read from your slides, and avoid monotonously reciting the content from memory.
- You may do a test presentation with us if you like. However, this is not mandatory (but **highly** recommended!).
- In general, your presentation should be viewed as a 'high level' summary of your thesis. However, questions might go into detail.
- Include an introduction in your presentation so that people who are not familiar with your specific topic can still follow the talk.
- Your original contribution should be clearly stated in the presentation.
- You can use any slide template that you like. You can also find slide templates at https://gitlab.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/templates/presentation_templates however you need to remove the university of tuebingen logo if you are using these.
- In any case, you should rehearse the presentation at least once on your own to check the timing.
- If your topic allows it, you may include a demo after the formal presentation. A good demo is a big plus. **Prepare a video of the demo as backup!**

## General Recommendations

### Note-taking
Keep notes of what you have done and your progress. This makes it easier to estimate progress and will make writing at the end go more smoothly. Some people like to use Kanban/Trello/Obsidian/etc. Personally, I use a simple text/Markdown file and tag entries (LEARNING, TODO, FINDING, RESULT, ...).

### Tool Recommendations
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): robust versioning (GitHub or our [GitLab](https://gitlab.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/)). If you are new to Git: [Git Guide](https://github.com/git-guides), [Git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com): simple and highly customizable (however you can use any IDE you prefer)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): stable, independent environments. Consider a [Docker development environment workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code/). See also: [TUTORIAL_DOCKER.md](TUTORIAL_DOCKER.md)
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): manage papers, highlights, notes, and citations
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/): A typesetting system allowing precise creation of your written thesis, taking many things like manually managing citations off your mind. I personally like to use the [texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) distribution which can be installed on ubuntu using `sudo apt install texlive-full`, or on windows following the [Windows Installation Instructions](https://tug.org/texlive/windows.html) and the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) VSCode extension. 


### AI Assisted Coding

Generative AI tools are becoming increasingly important for modern software development. Your thesis presents an excellent opportunity to explore these technologies and integrate them into your workflow. However, given the rapid pace of development in this field, strategies and tools evolve quickly, so these tips should be taken as my personal opinion.

#### General Guidelines
- **Avoid "Vibe-coding"**: You will quickly find that pure "vibe-coding" (generating code without true understanding and oversight) will not work well in solving actually complicated problems and will produce extremely large amounts of unwieldy code and slow you down immensely. **You are solely responsible for the code you create and commit!**
- **IDE-based Workflow**: I personally like to use an IDE-based workflow that allows you to review proposed changes (diffs) meticulously. I recommend [GitHub Copilot Pro](https://education.github.com/pack) which is free for students and provides access to state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-5.3, Claude Sonnet/Opus, Gemini 3).
- **CLI Tools**: You can also try cli-based systems like [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/), [Gemini-CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), and [claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) which often work better for "vibe-coding" style development, since the models are finetuned to work in these specific environments. However, they give me too little precise control (e.g. diff views) for high-quality production grade code, or code which will live for a longer time. 
- **Agentic tools** are very powerful. If possible, let the AI iterate based on tool feedback until the desired output is achieved (e.g. to iterate until a build passes, or until some test passes).
- You can attach images or screenshots (e.g., to sketch a figure you want the AI to create in tikz/matplotlib).
- Make sure to sufficiently **sandbox** the AI agents. A docker development container workflow works very well for this.
- Make sure to **save and backup your codebase** well for iteration by using git. AI agents often break things!
- You can create custom prompts for common tasks with `.prompt.md` files and general instructions with `.instruction.md` files. To do this press the settings wheel and select `Prompt Files` or `Instructions & Rules`. 
- In the process of writing a good prompt, you often already get a better grasp on the problem (cf. [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)).
- Put great effort into the high-level design / architecture (this is where models are lacking and technical debt is acquired)
- Treat vibe-coded code as discarable and do not waste time trying to fix it. Trying to reason with AI models an exercise in futility.

#### Model Recommendations
- **General Tasks**: **Gemini X.X Flash** This is my go-to model for almost all daily tasks, since it is fast, cheap and quite capable.
- **In-depth Coding**: **Claude Sonnet** is excellent for coding (e.g., refactoring), while **Claude Opus** has strong high-level abstraction and planning capabilities but is more expensive. For an initial draft of a vibe-coded project I would highly recommend to start with **Claude Opus** and then use cheaper models for the refinement.
- **High Level Planning and knowledge**: I find that **GPT-X.X** has the best knowledge of software libraries, while it is lacking in coding in comparison to **Claude Sonnet**. **Gemini** is somewhere in the middle between these two models in both regards.
- **GPT-(...)-Codex** sadly does not work well for me in VSCode, however this model is reported to be very good in OpenAI-Codex.

#### Uses where I find AI assisted coding tools highly useful:
- **Creating initial prototypes** which will not be iterated on further. Here the AI allows you to find whether something is in principle feasible or useful. 
- **Implementing changes from precise human specifications** under strict oversight for "production-grade" codebases. That is, save typing effort. 
- **Iterating in an agentic tool call fashion** to find a prototype or to fix a specific problem (e.g. build issues).
- **As a sparring partner** to examine or explain code or discuss potential options. However, everything needs to be verified with your own intelligence. If you really want to understand some code, you need to read it yourself, the AI only provides you with an initial lay of the land.
- **to clean up written text, e.g. documentation or academic writing** (but with high amounts of oversight).
- **For refactoring, to implement style guides or type hints.**

#### Uses where AI assisted coding does not work for me:
- To implement critical code.
- To one-shot full complex tasks. It is your job to break this down into feasible smaller tasks.
- To solve novel problems, i.e. specific tasks, which have not been solved often in the training data.
- Dealing with side effects / global state / „the real world“, i.e. any application where real world state needs to be managed (e.g. robotics, multi-threaded applications).
- It does not know when a task is impossible, it will just iterate and hallucinate.
